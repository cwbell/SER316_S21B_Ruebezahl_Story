It was a beautiful summer day in Raesfeld when Dr. Mehlhase set off in her Audi.
She was off to the biergarten to play a few games of tbwewrbsfaehig with some old friends.
While traveling the Hauptstrasse, she noticed some Gebaeck in a nearby Baeckerei.
So, she gathered her best pair of Lederhose and took the first flight to Berlin.
