It was a beautiful summer day in Raesfeld when Dr. Mehlhase set off in her Audi.
She was off to the biergarten to play a few games of tbwewrbsfaehig with some old friends.
While traveling the Hauptstrasse, she noticed some Gebaeck in a nearby Baeckerei.
So, she gathered her best pair of Lederhose and took the first flight to Berlin. 
When she landed at the Flughafen, she realized that she had forgotten her bratwurst!
Who on earth remembers their brot and nothing else?
A brot and a Bratwurst is all anyone really brings with them.
She took an Uber, which just so happend to be a porsche, to the nearest Ratskeller for some bier and musik.
